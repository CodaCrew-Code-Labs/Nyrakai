## Overview

While most Nyrakai vocabulary is built through [Morphology](../05-morphology/) (derivation and compounding), certain word classes have special status:

### Onomatopoeia

Sound-words believed to be "echoes of the first sounds." These roots use exotic consonants (ejectives, affricates) and carry sacred or taboo associations. Some are forbidden outside ritual contexts.

### Borrowing

Rules for adapting foreign words into Nyrakai phonology. The Ŧɒñœrek encountered many languages over 4,000 years, yet borrowing was strictly controlled to preserve the language's purity.
