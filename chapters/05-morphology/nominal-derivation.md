# Nominal Derivation

Nominal derivation transforms **nouns** into other nouns with specific semantic relationships. These suffixes attach to noun roots and express concepts like guardianship, place, essence, instrumentality, collectivity, and sacred intensification.

## Sample Noun Roots

| Root | Meaning | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **țræn** | person | CCVC |
| **na'ēr** | water | CV'VC |
| **fœra** | earth | CVCV |
| **r'ōk** | death | C'VC (Sacred) |

## 1. Keeper / Guardian → **-raš**

Marks the one bound to guard, keep, or tend to something.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| țræn | **țræn-raš** | leader, keeper of people |
| na'ēr | **na'ēr-raš** | water-bearer, river-guardian |
| r'ōk | **r'ōk-raš** | death-keeper, one who ushers death |
| fœra | **fœra-raš** | earth-warden, keeper of the land |

**Pronunciation:** /raʃ/ — the š reduces to "sh" in this suffix

**Compare with -ƨu:** The keeper -raš derives from nouns (thing→keeper), while -ƨu derives from verbs (action→doer). A na'ēr-raš *guards* water; a ƶōrƨu *does* the burning.

## 2. Place / Domain → **-bren**

Marks a place, settlement, or domain tied to a root.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| țræn | **țræn-bren** | settlement, place of people |
| na'ēr | **na'ēr-bren** | river, water-place |
| r'ōk | **r'ōk-bren** | place of death, burial ground |
| fœra | **fœra-bren** | land, earth-place |

**Pronunciation:** /bren/

## 3. Essence / State → **-țæl**

Forms abstract essences and states of being. The diphthong **æ** marks elevated or sacred meaning.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| țræn | **țræn-țæl** | personhood, essence of being |
| na'ēr | **na'ēr-țæl** | essence of water, liquidity |
| r'ōk | **r'ōk-țæl** | mortality, the nature of death |
| fœra | **fœra-țæl** | earthness, groundedness |

**Pronunciation:** /θail/ — ț is "th" as in "think," æ is the diphthong /ai/

**Compare with -țal:** The essence -țæl derives from nouns (thing→essence), while -țal derives from verbs (action→result). țræn-țæl is the abstract nature of personhood; ƶōrțal is ash, the physical result of burning.

---

## 4. Tool / Instrument → **-šek**

Marks the means, vessel, or tool associated with something.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| țræn | **țræn-šek** | servant, one used by another |

| r'ōk | **r'ōk-šek** | weapon, instrument of death |
| fœra | **fœra-šek** | stone-tool, object of earth |

**Pronunciation:** /tʃek/ — the š is the affricate in "church"

---

## 5. Collective / Lineage → **-raun**

Expands a root into a group, lineage, or collective.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| țræn | **țræn-raun** | the people, tribe |
| na'ēr | **na'ēr-raun** | waters, rivers collectively |
| r'ōk | **r'ōk-raun** | the dead collectively, ancestors |

**Pronunciation:** /raʊn/ — rhymes with "crown"

---

## 6. Sacred Intensifier → **-k^æț**

Compresses a root into a sacred or taboo form. The ejective **k^** and dental fricative **ț** create a harsh, otherworldly sound.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| țræn | **țræn-k^æț** | the chosen, forbidden people |
| na'ēr | **na'ēr-k^æț** | abyssal flood, forbidden waters |
| r'ōk | **r'ōk-k^æț** | the unspeakable death, annihilation |
| fœra | **fœra-k^æț** | deep earth, forbidden ground |

**Pronunciation:** /k'aiθ/ — sharp ejective k, diphthong ai, dental fricative th

**Usage:** This suffix is used sparingly. In the lore of the Ŧɒñœrek, speaking a -k^æț form outside of ritual context is considered dangerous.

## Summary Table

| Affix | IPA | Function | Example |
|-------|-----|----------|---------|
| **-raš** | /raʃ/ | Keeper/Guardian | na'ēr→na'ēr-raš (water-keeper) |
| **-bren** | /bren/ | Place/Domain | fœra→fœra-bren (land) |

## The æ Marker

Nominal suffixes containing **æ** indicate sacred or elevated register:
- **-țæl** (essence) — philosophical, abstract
- **-k^æț** (sacred intensifier) — ritual, forbidden

This contrasts with their verbal counterparts (-țal) which lack the sacred marker.

## Stacking Nominal Suffixes

Multiple suffixes can combine in formal or sacred contexts:

- **țræn-raš-raun** → the leaders (collective of keepers)
- **r'ōk-bren-k^æț** → forbidden burial ground

**Order:** Root + Primary Suffix + Secondary Suffix

When stacking, the innermost suffix modifies the root first, then the outer suffix modifies the result.
