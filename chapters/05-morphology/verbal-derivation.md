# Verbal Derivation

Verbal derivation transforms **verbs** into other parts of speech. These suffixes attach to verb roots and derive nouns, adjectives, or modified verb forms.

## Sample Verb Roots

| Root | Meaning | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **ƶōr** | burn | CVC |
| **nōr** | know | CVC |
| **lem** | hear | CVC |
| **pæl** | walk | CVC |

---

## 1. Nominalizer → **-ra**

Transforms a verb into an abstract noun representing the action or its typical result.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| ƶōr | **ƶōrra** | fire (the burning thing) |
| n'æ | **n'æra** | truth (that which is true) |

**Pronunciation:** /ra/

**Note:** This suffix also appears as the feminine plural marker on pronouns. Context distinguishes them: nominalizer attaches to verbs/adjectives, plural attaches to pronouns/nouns.

---

## 2. Agentive (Doer) → **-ƨu**

Marks the one who performs the action.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| ƶōr | **ƶōrƨu** | burner, arsonist |
| nōr | **nōrƨu** | knower, sage |
| lem | **lemƨu** | listener, hearer |
| pæl | **pælƨu** | walker, traveler |

**Pronunciation:** /tsu/

**Compare with -raš:** The agentive -ƨu derives from verbs (action→doer), while -raš derives from nouns (thing→keeper). A ƶōrƨu *does* the burning; a ƶōrra-raš *keeps* the fire.

---

## 3. Resultative → **-țal**

Marks the result, remains, or outcome of an action.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| ƶōr | **ƶōrțal** | ash (result of burning) |
| nōr | **nōrțal** | knowledge (result of knowing) |
| lem | **lemțal** | memory (result of hearing) |

**Pronunciation:** /θal/

**Compare with -țæl:** The resultative -țal derives from verbs (action→result), while -țæl derives from nouns (thing→essence). ƶōrțal is what remains after burning; țræn-țæl is the abstract essence of personhood.

---

## 4. Diminutive → **-k^e**

Creates a smaller, lesser, or gentler version of the action's result.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| ƶōr | **ƶōrk^e** | ember (small fire) |
| na'ēr | **na'ērk^e** | rain (small/falling water) |
| zwūr | **zwūrk^e** | sand (small stones) |

**Pronunciation:** /k'e/ — with ejective k

**Note:** Can also attach to nouns for physical diminutives.

---

## 5. Augmentative → **-ñor**

Creates a greater, more intense version.

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| ƶōr | **ƶōrñor** | inferno (great fire) |
| ƨæ | **ƨæñor** | wind (intense air) |
| nōr | **nōrñor** | wisdom (deep knowledge) |

**Pronunciation:** /ŋor/

---

## 6. Adjectivizer → **-ɛm**

Transforms a noun or verb into an adjective meaning "like X" or "of X."

| Root | Derived | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| raț | **rațɛm** | nightly, of the night |
| hīra | **hīrɛm** | sunny, of the sun |
| r'ōk | **r'ōkɛm** | deathly, death-like |

**Pronunciation:** /eim/
