# Compounding

Nyrakai forms compound words by joining two or more roots. Compounding is productive and follows consistent rules that reflect the language's head-final structure.

## Compound Structure

Nyrakai compounds are **head-final**: the last element determines the grammatical category and core meaning, while preceding elements modify or specify.

```
Modifier + Head = Compound
```

| Compound | Parts | Literal | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|---------|
| **na'ēr-fœra** | na'ēr (water) + fœra (earth) | water-earth | mud, marshland |
| **fœra-na'ēr** | fœra (earth) + na'ēr (water) | earth-water | groundwater, well |
| **r'ōk-țræn** | r'ōk (death) + țræn (person) | death-person | the dying, death-bound one |
| **țræn-r'ōk** | țræn (person) + r'ōk (death) | person-death | murder, killing of a person |

**Note:** Order matters! The head (final element) determines what the compound fundamentally *is*.

## Types of Compounds

### 1. Noun + Noun

The most common type. Creates a new noun.

| Compound | Meaning | Analysis |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **ƶōr-fœra** | volcanic earth, scorched land | fire + earth |
| **hīra-na'ēr** | sacred waters, sunlit water | sun + water |
| **r'ōk-raț** | death-night, the final night | death + night |

### 2. Adjective + Noun

Adjective modifies the noun head. Often written as compounds rather than separate words.

| Compound | Meaning | Analysis |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **grōm-țræn** | giant, great person | big + person |
| **sem-p^ān** | good path, righteous way | good + path |
| **dem-na'ēr** | foul water, poison | bad + water |

### 3. Verb Root + Noun

The verb root acts as a modifier describing action related to the noun.

| Compound | Meaning | Analysis |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **ƶōr-țræn** | arsonist, burner | burn + person |
| **nōr-țræn** | sage, knower | know + person |
| **lem-šek** | listening device, ear-tool | hear + tool |

## Compounding with Derived Words

Derived forms can enter compounds. The derivational suffix stays attached to its root.

| Compound | Parts | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **r'ōk-raš-bren** | death-keeper + place | mortuary, house of death-keepers |
| **țræn-raun-p^ān** | people-collective + path | tribal road, migration path |
| **na'ēr-țæl-šek** | water-essence + tool | purifier, water-cleanser |

## Sacred Compounds

Compounds involving sacred roots or the **-k^æț** suffix are handled with care. They often:

1. Use compressed forms
2. Appear in fixed phrases only
3. Carry ritual weight

| Compound | Meaning | Context |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **n'æ-kæ** | truth-tongue | The language name: Nyrakai |
| **r'ōk-n'æra** | death-truth | Final truth, deathbed confession |
| **r'ōk-k^æț-bren** | forbidden-death-place | Lost tomb, cursed burial ground |

## Phonological Rules

### Linking

When compounding creates awkward consonant clusters, a linking vowel **-a-** may be inserted:

- Rare in practice; Nyrakai generally tolerates clusters

### Stress

In compounds, primary stress falls on the **first element** (the modifier), secondary stress on the head:

- **NA'ĒR-fœra** (mud): stress on NA'ĒR
- **R'ŌK-țræn** (the dying): stress on R'ŌK

### Written Form

Compounds are hyphenated in romanization to show structure:

- **na'ēr-fœra** (not *na'ērfœra*)
- **țræn-raun-p^ān** (not *țrænraunp^ān*)

---

## Productive vs. Lexicalized

Some compounds are **productive** (can be formed freely):
- na'ēr-fœra (mud) — any speaker could form this

Others are **lexicalized** (fixed meanings, must be learned):
- n'æ-kæ (Nyrakai) — fixed proper noun

Over time, productive compounds may become lexicalized as they gain specific cultural meanings.

## Summary

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Head-final** | Last element is the head |
| **Order matters** | na'ēr-fœra ≠ fœra-na'ēr |
| **Hyphenated** | Written with hyphens |
| **Stress on modifier** | First element takes primary stress |
| **Stacking OK** | Derived forms can compound |
