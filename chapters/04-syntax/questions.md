# Questions

Nyrakai forms questions using the sentence-final particle **ka** combined with interrogative words for specific information.

---

## The Question Particle: ka

| Element | Form | Function |
|---------|------|----------|
| **ka** | /ka/ | Marks any sentence as a question |

The particle **ka** appears at the very end of the sentence, after all other elements including aspect markers. It does not attach to any word — it stands alone.

---

## Yes/No Questions

To form a yes/no question, simply add **ka** to the end of a statement:

**Statement:**
```
O + Vs + S + Va
[object] [verb] [subject] [aspect]
```

**Question:**
```
O + Vs + S + Va ka
[object] [verb] [subject] [aspect] Q
```

### Examples

| Statement | Question | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| hīn p^ɛn šā [asp] | hīn p^ɛn šā [asp] ka | "She sees the star" → "Does she see the star?" |
| na'ēr țūn gæ [asp] | na'ēr țūn gæ [asp] ka | "You drink water" → "Do you drink water?" |

## WH-Questions (Information Questions)

For questions seeking specific information, Nyrakai uses interrogative words in their natural position within the sentence, with **ka** at the end.

### Interrogative Words

| Nyrakai | IPA | Meaning | Type |
|---------|-----|---------|------|
| **kwæ** | /kwai/ | what | pronoun |
| **hœr** | /hoir/ | who | pronoun |

*Additional interrogatives (where, when, why, how) to be added.*

---

## WH-Question Structure

The interrogative word occupies the position of the element being questioned:

**"What does she see?"**
```
kwæ + p^ɛn + šā + [asp] ka
what + see + she + [asp] Q
```
(kwæ replaces the object)

**"Who sees the star?"**
```
hīn + p^ɛn + hœr + [asp] ka
star + see + who + [asp] Q
```
(hœr replaces the subject)

---

## Question Intonation

While **ka** grammatically marks questions, spoken Nyrakai also uses rising intonation on the final syllable. In formal or sacred contexts, the particle alone suffices without tonal change.

---

## Negative Questions

Combine the negation prefix **za-** with the question particle **ka**:

**"Does she not see?"**
```
hīn + zap^ɛn + šā + [asp] ka
star + NEG-see + she + [asp] Q
```

## Summary

| Question Type | Formation | Example |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Yes/No | statement + ka | `... ka` |
| What | kwæ in object position + ka | `kwæ ... ka` |
| Who | hœr in subject position + ka | `... hœr ... ka` |
| Negative | za- prefix + ka | `... za-V ... ka` |

## Notes

- **ka** never attaches to words; it remains a separate particle
- The OVSV word order is preserved; **ka** simply follows the complete sentence
- In rapid speech, **ka** may sound like a soft exhale — this is acceptable
- Similar sentence-final question particles exist in Japanese (か), Mandarin (吗), and Korean (까) — Nyrakai follows this typological pattern
