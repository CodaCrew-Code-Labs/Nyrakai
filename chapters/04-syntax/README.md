# Syntax

The syntactic rules of Nyrakai govern sentence structure, word order, and how meaning is constructed from parts.

## Overview

Nyrakai uses **OVSV (Object-VerbStem-Subject-VerbAspect)** word order, which is rare among natural languages. This structure:

• Places emphasis on the **object** (what is affected)
• Wraps the **subject** between verb components
• Creates natural ambiguity for uninitiated listeners

Additional syntactic features:
• **Postpositions** (not prepositions): "death over" not "over death"
• **Adjectives precede nouns**: "great fire" = [great][fire]
• **Poetic inversion** allowed in ceremonial/oath contexts
