# Word Order

Nyrakai uses **OVSV** word order: Object – VerbStem – Subject – VerbAspect. This unusual structure places focus on what is affected (the object) and wraps the subject between verb components, creating natural ambiguity for uninitiated listeners.

---

## Basic Structure: OVSV

| Position | Element | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| 1 | **O** (Object) | What is affected |
| 2 | **Vs** (Verb Stem) | The core action |
| 3 | **S** (Subject) | Who performs the action |
| 4 | **Va** (Verb Aspect) | Completion, tense, mood |

### The Split Verb

Nyrakai splits the verb into two parts:
- **Verb Stem (Vs):** The root action (see, eat, know)
- **Verb Aspect (Va):** When/how it happens (completed, ongoing, etc.)

This "wrapping" of the subject creates sentences that are harder for outsiders to parse — fitting for a secret language.

## Simple Examples

### "I see the star"

```
hīn     yɛn    fā      [aspect]
star    see     I       [completed]
O       Vs      S       Va

"The star, see, I, [did]"
```

### "She drinks water"

```
na'ēr   țūn     šā      [aspect]
water   drink   she     [ongoing]
O       Vs      S       Va

"Water, drink, she, [is doing]"
```

### "They know the truth"

```
n'æra   šōr     šāri    [aspect]
truth   know    they    [habitual]
O       Vs      S       Va

"Truth, know, they, [always]"
```

---

## Intransitive Sentences (No Object)

When there is no object, the sentence begins with the verb:

```
Vs + S + Va
```

### "I sleep"

```
slōm     fā      [aspect]
sleep   I       [completed]
Vs      S       Va
```

### "The bird flies"

```
fīr     tūk     [aspect]
fly     bird    [ongoing]
Vs      S       Va
```

---

## Adjective Placement

Adjectives come **before** the noun they modify:

| Structure | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| ADJ + NOUN | grōm ƶōrra = "big fire" |

### "I see the big star"

```
grōm hīn    yɛn    fā      [aspect]
big star    see     I       [completed]
[ADJ O]     Vs      S       Va
```

### Multiple Adjectives

Adjectives stack before the noun:

```
grōm sem hīn = "big good star" (a great, good star)
```

---

## Postpositions

Nyrakai uses **postpositions** (after the noun) instead of prepositions:

| English | Nyrakai | Structure |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| over death | r'ōk añ | NOUN + POSTP |
| on the mountain | t^arak añ | NOUN + POSTP |

### Regular Postposition Phrases

The postposition follows the noun it governs:

```
r'ōk    añ
death   over
NOUN    POSTP

"over death"
```

### In Sentences

Postpositional phrases typically appear at the beginning (topic position):

**"Truth stands over death"**
```
r'ōk añ     stīr     n'æra   [aspect]
death over  stand   truth   [eternal]
[PP]        Vs      S       Va

"Over death, truth stands [eternally]"
```

### The Sacred Motto

The motto **N'æra añ r'ōk** uses a special poetic construction where the postposition links two nouns directly:

```
n'æra   añ      r'ōk
truth   over    death

"Truth over death"
```

This elliptical form (omitting the verb "stands" or "prevails") is reserved for oaths and sacred phrases. In everyday speech, a full sentence structure would be required.

## Questions

Questions maintain OVSV order with **ka** added at the end:

### Yes/No Questions

```
hīn     yɛn    šā      [aspect]    ka
star    see     she     [completed] Q

"Did she see the star?"
```

### WH-Questions

The interrogative word replaces the element being questioned:

**"What does she see?"** (kwæ replaces object)
```
kwæ     yɛn    šā      [aspect]    ka
what    see     she     [completed] Q
```

**"Who sees the star?"** (hœr replaces subject)
```
hīn     yɛn    hœr     [aspect]    ka
star    see     who     [completed] Q
```

---

## Negation

The prefix **za-** attaches to the verb stem:

```
hīn     zayɛn  fā      [aspect]
star    NEG-see I       [completed]

"I do not see the star"
```

---

## Poetic/Ceremonial Inversion

In oaths, mottos, and ritual speech, word order may shift for emphasis:

### Standard
```
n'æra añ r'ōk = "truth over death"
```

### Inverted (for emphasis on death)
```
r'ōk añ n'æra = "death, over it: truth"
```

The motto of the Ŧɒñœrek uses the standard form, placing **truth** in the position of prominence.

---

## Complex Sentences

### With Multiple Objects

When multiple objects exist, they appear in sequence before the verb:

```
na'ēr   ƶōrra   yɛn    fā      [aspect]
water   fire    see     I       [completed]

"I see water and fire"
```

### Relative Clauses

*Structure for relative clauses to be developed.*

## Why OVSV?

This word order serves the Nine Unknown:

1. **Object Focus:** What is affected matters most in secret communication
2. **Subject Buried:** The actor is wrapped inside the verb, obscuring agency
3. **Aspect at End:** Timing information comes last, allowing interruption
4. **Ambiguity:** Outsiders hearing fragments cannot easily reconstruct meaning

## Summary Table

| Sentence Type | Structure | Example |
|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Basic transitive | O + Vs + S + Va | hīn yɛn fā [asp] |
| Intransitive | Vs + S + Va | slōm fā [asp] |
| With adjective | [Adj O] + Vs + S + Va | grōm hīn yɛn fā [asp] |
| Question | O + Vs + S + Va + ka | hīn yɛn šā [asp] ka |
| Negative | O + za-Vs + S + Va | hīn zayɛn fā [asp] |
| With postposition | [PP] + Vs + S + Va | r'ōk añ stīr n'æra [asp] |

## Notes

- The split verb construction is mandatory; stem and aspect cannot merge
- In casual speech, aspect markers may be reduced or implied by context
- Sacred register requires full, deliberate pronunciation of all elements
- The Whispered register may drop objects when context is shared
