# Registers

Nyrakai distinguishes between different speech registers — styles of speaking appropriate for different contexts. The same grammar applies to all registers, but word choice, sound patterns, and delivery shift based on social context.

## Overview

| Register | Context | Sound Profile | Examples |
|----------|---------|---------------|----------|
| **Everyday** | Daily conversation, trade, casual | Soft consonants, flowing | "Give me water" |
| **Formal** | Ceremonies, oaths, addressing elders | Ejectives, deliberate pacing | Marriage vows |
| **Sacred** | Rituals, invoking cosmic forces | Schwa-glottal patterns, sacred vocabulary | "Truth over death" |
| **Whispered** | Secret communication among the Nine | Minimal volume, precise articulation | Identity confirmation |

---

## Everyday Register (Tælran)

The default mode of speech for daily life.

### Characteristics

- **Consonants:** Prefers soft sounds — n, m, l, r, s
- **Syllables:** Simple structures — CV, CVC
- **Pace:** Natural, flowing
- **Vocabulary:** Common words, flexible-gender nouns

### Sound Preferences

| Preferred | Avoided/Rare |
|-----------|--------------|
| n, m, l, r | k^, p^, t^ (ejectives) |
| Short vowels | ' (schwa-glottal) |
| Simple onsets | Complex clusters |

### Example

```
na'ēr țūn fā
water drink I
"I drink water"
```

---

## Formal Register (Šālran)

Used for ceremonies, public oaths, and addressing those of higher status.

### Characteristics

- **Consonants:** Incorporates ejectives (k^, p^, t^) for weight
- **Syllables:** Allows complex onsets (CCVC)
- **Pace:** Slower, more deliberate
- **Vocabulary:** Formal terms, proper titles

### Sound Preferences

| Preferred | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Ejectives (k^, p^, t^) | Authority, finality |
| Long vowels (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū) | Gravitas |
| Affricates (š, ƶ) | Formality |

### Example

```
n'æra k^el fāri
truth create we
"We create truth" (formal oath)
```

---

## Sacred Register (R'ōkran)

Reserved for rituals, invocations, and speaking of cosmic forces. Named after r'ōk (death) — the ultimate sacred concept.

### Characteristics

- **Consonants:** Heavy use of ' (schwa-glottal combination)
- **Vocabulary:** Sacred-gender nouns only (sun, moon, death, truth, name)
- **Pace:** Slow, weighted, each syllable distinct
- **Context:** Funerals, astronomical events, oath-binding

### Sound Preferences

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| ' (schwa-glottal) | Creates "catch" in throat — reverence |
| Sacred vocabulary | r'ōk, hīra, hūn, n'æra, sre'un |
| Ejectives | Seals meaning with finality |

### The Sacred Vocabulary

Words of sacred gender carry inherent weight:

| Word | Meaning | Why Sacred |
|------|---------|------------|
| r'ōk | death | The ultimate mystery |
| hīra | sun | Source of all life |
| hūn | moon | Keeper of cycles |
| n'æra | truth | What the Nine protect |
| sre'un | name | Identity itself |
| kæ | tongue | Vehicle of truth |
| yūm | blood | Life force |
| wōr | flesh | Mortality |

### Example

```
N'æra añ r'ōk
Truth over death
"Truth over death" (motto of the Ŧɒñœrek)
```

---

## Whispered Register (Ñœrekran)

The secret speech of the Nine Unknown. Named after ñœrek (unknown).

### Characteristics

- **Volume:** Near-silent, relies on precise articulation
- **Consonants:** Emphasizes distinctive sounds that carry at low volume
- **Purpose:** Identification, passing secrets, avoiding detection
- **Context:** When members of the Nine must confirm identity

### Sound Preferences

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| ñ (velar nasal) | Carries in whispers |
| Affricates (ƨ, ŧ) | Distinctive even quiet |
| Long vowels | Sustain without volume |

### Identification Protocol

A member of the Nine might whisper a sacred phrase; only another member would know the correct response. The whispered register ensures this exchange remains inaudible to outsiders.

## Register Mixing

Registers can blend based on context:

| Situation | Register Mix |
|-----------|--------------|
| Funeral of a commoner | Everyday + Sacred |
| Secret oath among the Nine | Whispered + Sacred |
| Merchant negotiation | Everyday (possibly Formal for large deals) |
| Crowning ceremony | Formal + Sacred |

---

## Summary

| Register | Key Marker | When Used |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Everyday | Soft consonants, simple syllables | Daily life |
| Formal | Ejectives, deliberate pace | Ceremonies, respect |
| Sacred | ' patterns, sacred vocabulary | Rituals, cosmic matters |
| Whispered | Minimal volume, precise sounds | Secrets of the Nine |

---

## Notes

- Register is **not** grammatically marked — it emerges from word choice and delivery
- A speaker can shift registers mid-conversation for effect
- Using Sacred register for trivial matters is considered disrespectful
- The Whispered register is known only to descendants of the Nine
