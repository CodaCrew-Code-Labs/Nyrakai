## Overview

Nyrakai features a **two-gender system** (masculine/feminine) with special exceptions for sacred concepts. Plurality is marked through gender-specific suffixes, creating a layered morphological structure.

Key features:
• **Gender suffixes:** -æn (masculine), -ñī (feminine)
• **Plural suffixes:** -œ (masculine), -ā (feminine)
• **Sacred words:** Exempt from gender marking
• **Inherent gender:** Some nouns have cultural gender associations
