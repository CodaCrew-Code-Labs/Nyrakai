## Overview

Nyrakai features a **two-gender system** (masculine/feminine) with special exceptions for sacred concepts. Plurality is marked through gender-specific suffixes, creating a layered morphological structure.

Key features:
• **Gender suffixes:** -æn (masculine), -ñī (feminine)
• **Plural suffixes:** -œ (masculine), -ā (feminine)
• **Possession prefixes:** fā- (my), gæ- (your), šā- (his/her)
• **Sacred words:** Exempt from gender marking
• **Inherent gender:** Some nouns have cultural gender associations
• **Case system:** Marks grammatical roles (in development)
