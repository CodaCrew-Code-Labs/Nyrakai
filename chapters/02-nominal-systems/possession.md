# Possession System

Nyrakai marks possession through prefixes that fuse directly to nouns. The system derives from personal pronouns and distinguishes between singular and collective (plural) possession.

---

## Direct Possession (Singular Prefixes)

Derived from singular pronouns (long vowels preserved for clarity):

| Prefix | Meaning | Source Pronoun |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **fā-** | my | fā (I) |
| **gæ-** | your | gæ (you) |
| **šā-** | his / her / its | šā (he/she/it) |

---

## Collective Possession (Plural Prefixes)

Derived from plural pronouns. Gender suffixes (-ri masculine, -ra feminine) reflect the gender of the **possessors**:

### Masculine / Mixed Groups

| Prefix | Meaning | Source Pronoun |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **fāri-** | our (masculine / mixed) | fāri (we m.) |
| **gæri-** | your (plural, masculine / mixed) | gæri (you all m.) |
| **šāri-** | their (masculine / mixed) | šāri (they m.) |

### Feminine Groups

| Prefix | Meaning | Source Pronoun |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **fāra-** | our (feminine / all-female) | fāra (we f.) |
| **gæra-** | your (plural, feminine / all-female) | gæra (you all f.) |
| **šāra-** | their (feminine / all-female) | šāra (they f.) |

## Word Order

Possessive prefixes fuse to the beginning of the noun, before the root:

```
[POSSESSIVE PREFIX] + [ROOT] + [GENDER SUFFIX] + [PLURAL SUFFIX]

fāri    +  țræn   +  æn         +  œ
(our m.)   (person)  (masculine)   (plural)
= fārițrænænœ (our men)
```

## Summary Table

| Possession | Singular | Plural (m.) | Plural (f.) |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1st person | fā- | fāri- | fāra- |
| 2nd person | gæ- | gæri- | gæra- |
| 3rd person | šā- | šāri- | šāra- |

---

## Notes

• Possessive prefixes fuse directly to the noun (no space)
• Long vowels are preserved in prefixes to clearly mark possession and avoid confusion with root syllables
• The choice between -ri and -ra collective forms reflects the gender of the **possessors**, not the possessed noun
• Sacred words (n'æra, r'ōk, etc.) take possessive prefixes but not gender/plural suffixes
• Inherently gendered nouns (na'ēr, fœra) only use forms matching their inherent gender
