# Pronoun System

Nyrakai pronouns follow a base + suffix pattern for number and gender.

## Singular Pronouns

| Pronoun | Meaning | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **fā** | I / me | 1st person singular |
| **gæ** | you | 2nd person singular |
| **šā** | he / she / it | 3rd person singular (gender neutral) |

## Plural Pronouns (Gendered)

Plural is formed by adding gender suffixes to the singular base:

**Masculine plural → suffix -ri**
**Feminine plural → suffix -rā**

### First Person Plural (we)

| Pronoun | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **fāri** | we (masculine / mixed group) |
| **fārā** | we (feminine / all-female group) |

### Second Person Plural (you all)

| Pronoun | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **gæri** | you all (masculine / mixed group) |
| **gærā** | you all (feminine / all-female group) |

### Third Person Plural (they)

| Pronoun | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **šāri** | they (masculine / mixed group) |
| **šārā** | they (feminine / all-female group) |

## Summary Table

| Person | Singular | Plural (m.) | Plural (f.) |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1st | fā | fāri | fārā |
| 2nd | gæ | gæri | gærā |
| 3rd | šā | šāri | šārā |

## Demonstrative Pronouns

Demonstratives indicate proximity:

| Pronoun | Meaning | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **šœ** | this | Proximal (near speaker) |
| **šɒ** | that | Distal (far from speaker) |

The š- pattern links demonstratives to the 3rd person pronoun šā.

## Notes

• Masculine plural forms are also used for mixed-gender groups
• The 3rd person singular šā is gender-neutral; context determines the referent
• Pronoun plural suffixes (-ri/-rā) differ from noun plural suffixes (-œ/-ā): this is intentional, distinguishing pronominal from nominal morphology
