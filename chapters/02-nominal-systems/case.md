# Case System

Nyrakai employs a concise but expressive case system that blends everyday clarity with sacred precision. Each case is marked by a distinct suffix, designed to convey grammatical roles while retaining the language's ritual and alien character.

---

## Case Suffix Order

Case suffixes attach **after** gender, number, and possession:

```
[POSSESSION] + [ROOT] + [GENDER] + [PLURAL] + [CASE]

fā   + țræn + æn   + œ    + aš
(my)   (person) (masc) (plural) (accusative)
= fāțrænænœaš (my men, as direct object)
```

---

## Vowel Collision Rule

When a vowel-final word (especially pronouns) meets a vowel-initial case suffix, insert **-w-** as a glide:

| Base | + Suffix | Result | Meaning |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| fā + aš | → | fāwaš | me (accusative) |
| fā + ɒr | → | fāwɒr | from me |
| šā + aš | → | šāwaš | him/her (accusative) |
| gæ + aš | → | gæwaš | you (accusative) |
| gæ + iț | → | gæwiț | to you (dative) |

---

## Core Cases

### Nominative (unmarked)

Marks the **subject**: the one performing the action.

No suffix is added; the base form (with gender/number) serves as nominative.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| țrænæn | the man (subject) |
| țrænænœ | the men (subject) |
| na'ērñī | water (subject) |

---

### Accusative → -aš

Marks the **direct object**: the one receiving the action.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| țrænænaš | the man (object) |
| țrænænœaš | the men (object) |
| fāwaš | me (object) |

**Example:** "I see the man" → man takes -aš

---

### Genitive → -šar

Marks **possession**, belonging, or origin between nouns.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| țrænænšar | of the man / the man's |
| fœrænšar | of the earth |
| n'ærašar | of truth |

**Example:** "The man's sword" → man takes -šar

#### Genitive vs Possession Prefixes

These serve **different purposes**:

| Type | Use | Example |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Possession prefix** (fā-, gæ-, šā-) | Pronoun owns noun | fāțrænæn = "my man" |
| **Genitive case** (-šar) | Noun owns noun | țrænænšar = "the man's / of the man" |

**Combined example:** "My man's sword"
- "My man" = fāțrænæn
- "My man's" = fāțrænænšar (add genitive)
- Full: fāțrænænšar [sword] = "my man's sword"

---

### Dative → -iț

Marks the **indirect object**: recipient, beneficiary, or purpose.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| țrænæniț | to/for the man |
| țrænañīiț | to/for the woman |
| gæwiț | to you |

**Example:** "I give the book to the woman" → woman takes -iț

---

### Instrumental → -ek

Marks the **tool**, instrument, or means of an action.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| zwūrek | with/by stone |
| ƶōrraek | with/by fire |
| hǣnek | with/by hand |

**Example:** "I cut with a knife" → knife takes -ek

---

### Locative → -ñen

Marks **location**: in, on, or at a place.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| fœrænñen | on/at the earth |
| t^arakñen | on/at the mountain |
| na'ērñīñen | in the water |

**Example:** "I stand on the mountain" → mountain takes -ñen

---

### Ablative → -ɒr

Marks **source** or movement: from, out of, away.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| fœrænɒr | from the earth |
| t^arakɒr | from the mountain |
| hīraɒr | from the sun |
| fāwɒr | from me |

**Example:** "I come from the mountain" → mountain takes -ɒr

---

## Sacred Extensions

These cases are primarily used in ritual speech, oaths, and sacred contexts.

### Vocative → -ți

Used for **invocation** or direct address in sacred speech.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| n'ærați | O Truth! |
| r'ōkți | O Death! |
| Ŧɒñœrekți | O Nine Unknown! |

**Example:** "O Truth, guide us!" → truth takes -ți

---

### Privative → -zɒț

Marks **absence**, lack, or forbidden negation. Thematically connected to the negation system (zæ "not", za- prefix).

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| n'ærazɒț | without truth / truthless |

## Notes

• Case suffixes attach after all other noun morphology (possession, gender, number)
• The nominative is unmarked, making the subject form the "default"
• Insert glide **-w-** between vowels to prevent collision (fā + aš → fāwaš)
• Genitive (-šar) is for noun-to-noun possession; prefixes (fā-) are for pronoun-to-noun
• The privative case (-zɒț) is thematically linked to negation (zæ, za-)
• Vocative and privative are primarily sacred/literary; informal speech may omit them
