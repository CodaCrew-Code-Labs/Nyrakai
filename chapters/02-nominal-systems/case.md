# Case System

Nyrakai employs a concise but expressive case system that blends everyday clarity with sacred precision. Each case is marked by a distinct suffix, designed to convey grammatical roles while retaining the language's ritual and alien character.

---

## Case Suffix Order

Case suffixes attach **after** gender, number, and possession:

```
[POSSESSION] + [ROOT] + [GENDER] + [PLURAL] + [CASE]

fā   + țræn + æn   + œ    + aš
(my)   (person) (masc) (plural) (accusative)
= fāțrænænœaš (my men, as direct object)
```

---

## Vowel Collision Rule

When a vowel-final word (especially pronouns) meets a vowel-initial case suffix, insert **-w-** as a glide:

| Base | + Suffix | Result | Meaning |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| fā + aš | → | fāwaš | me (accusative) |
| fā + ɒr | → | fāwɒr | from me |
| šā + aš | → | šāwaš | him/her (accusative) |
| gæ + aš | → | gæwaš | you (accusative) |
| gæ + iț | → | gæwiț | to you (dative) |

---

## Core Cases

### Nominative (unmarked)

Marks the **subject**: the one performing the action.

No suffix is added; the base form (with gender/number) serves as nominative.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| țrænæn | the man (subject) |
| țrænænœ | the men (subject) |
| na'ērñī | water (subject) |
| hīra | sun (subject) |
| gān | tree (subject) |
| ƶærŧ | river (subject) |
| ƶūrek | village (subject) |

---

### Accusative → -aš

Marks the **direct object**: the one receiving the action.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| țrænænaš | the man (object) |
| țrænænœaš | the men (object) |
| fāwaš | me (object) |
| na'ēraš | water (object) |
| ƶōrraaš | fire (object) |
| gānaš | tree (object) |
| hīnaš | star (object) |
| n'ærawaš | truth (object) |
| ñ'ānaš | wisdom (object) |

**Examples:**
- "I see the man" → man takes -aš: țrænænaš
- "She drinks water" → water takes -aš: na'ēraš
- "We seek wisdom" → wisdom takes -aš: ñ'ānaš

---

### Genitive → -šar

Marks **possession**, belonging, or origin between nouns.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| țrænænšar | of the man / the man's |

#### Genitive vs Possession Prefixes

These serve **different purposes**:

| Type | Use | Example |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Possession prefix** (fā-, gæ-, šā-) | Pronoun owns noun | fāțrænæn = "my man" |
| **Genitive case** (-šar) | Noun owns noun | țrænænšar = "the man's / of the man" |

**Combined example:** "My man's sword"
- "My man" = fāțrænæn
- "My man's" = fāțrænænšar (add genitive)
- Full: fāțrænænšar [sword] = "my man's sword"

## Notes

• Case suffixes attach after all other noun morphology (possession, gender, number)
• The nominative is unmarked, making the subject form the "default"
• Insert glide **-w-** between vowels to prevent collision (fā + aš → fāwaš)
• Genitive (-šar) is for noun-to-noun possession; prefixes (fā-) are for pronoun-to-noun
• The privative case (-zɒț) is thematically linked to negation (zæ, za-)
• Vocative and privative are primarily sacred/literary; informal speech may omit them
