# Case System

*Coming soon*

Nyrakai uses a case system to mark the grammatical role of nouns in a sentence.

---

## Planned Cases

- **Nominative** — Subject of the sentence
- **Accusative** — Direct object
- **Dative** — Indirect object / recipient
- **Genitive** — Possession / "of" relationship

---

## Notes

Case markers will likely be suffixes that attach after gender/number markers:

```
[ROOT] + [GENDER] + [NUMBER] + [CASE]
```

Details to be developed.
