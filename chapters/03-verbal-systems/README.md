# Verbal Systems

The verbal system of Nyrakai governs how verbs express action through aspect and mood. The language uses a unique split-verb construction within its OVSV word order.

## Contents

• [Aspect](aspect.md) — Completed, ongoing, habitual, potential, **voice (passive)**
• [Mood](mood.md) — Declarative, interrogative, imperative, optative, conditional

---

## Overview

Nyrakai verbs are built by attaching **voice**, **aspect**, and **mood** suffixes to the verb root:

```
[VERB ROOT] + [VOICE] + [ASPECT] + [MOOD]

tal + ∅   + arek + ka = talarekka
(say) (active) (completed) (question) = "Did [someone] say?"

dur + rōn + ațar + ∅  = durrōnațar
(use) (passive) (potential) (decl) = "can be used"
```

### Voice (2 types)
Indicates whether subject performs or receives action:
| Voice | Marker | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Active | ∅ | Subject performs action |
| Passive | -rōn | Subject receives action |

### Aspect (4 types)
Indicates how an action unfolds in time:
| Aspect | Suffix | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Completed | -arek | Finished, sealed |
| Ongoing | -iræn | Continuous, flowing |
| Habitual | -aneț | Cyclical, eternal |
| Potential | -ațar | Possible, forbidden |

### Mood (5 types)
Indicates the speaker's attitude:
| Mood | Suffix | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Declarative | ∅ | Statement |
| Interrogative | -ka | Question |
| Imperative | -țiræ | Command |
| Optative | -hāli | Wish/blessing |
| Conditional | -wɒț | Hypothetical |

## No Explicit Tense

Nyrakai does not mark past/present/future explicitly. Temporal meaning comes from:
- Aspect choice (completed → past, ongoing → present)
- Context and time words
- Ritual framing (sacred speech transcends time)

This reflects the Ŧɒñœrek worldview: truth is eternal.
