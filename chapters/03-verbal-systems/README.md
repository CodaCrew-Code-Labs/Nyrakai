# Verbal Systems

The verbal system of Nyrakai governs how verbs express action through aspect and mood. The language uses a unique split-verb construction within its OVSV word order.

## Contents

• [Aspect](aspect.md) — Completed, ongoing, habitual, potential
• [Mood](mood.md) — Declarative, interrogative, imperative, optative, conditional

---

## Overview

Nyrakai verbs are built by attaching **aspect** and **mood** suffixes to the verb root:

```
[VERB ROOT] + [ASPECT] + [MOOD]

tal + arek + ka = talarekka
(say) (completed) (question) = "Did [someone] say?"
```

### Aspect (4 types)
Indicates how an action unfolds in time:
| Aspect | Suffix | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Completed | -arek | Finished, sealed |
| Ongoing | -iræn | Continuous, flowing |
| Habitual | -aneț | Cyclical, eternal |
| Potential | -ațar | Possible, forbidden |

### Mood (5 types)
Indicates the speaker's attitude:
| Mood | Suffix | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| Declarative | ∅ | Statement |
| Interrogative | -ka | Question |
| Imperative | -țiræ | Command |
| Optative | -hāli | Wish/blessing |
| Conditional | -wɒț | Hypothetical |

## No Explicit Tense

Nyrakai does not mark past/present/future explicitly. Temporal meaning comes from:
- Aspect choice (completed → past, ongoing → present)
- Context and time words
- Ritual framing (sacred speech transcends time)

This reflects the Ŧɒñœrek worldview: truth is eternal.
