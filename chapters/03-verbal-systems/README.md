# Verbal Systems

The verbal system of Nyrakai governs how verbs express action, tense, aspect, and mood.

## Overview

Nyrakai features a unique **split-verb construction** where the verb stem and aspect marker are separated by the subject:

```
Object + VerbStem + Subject + VerbAspect
```

This creates a distinctive sentence rhythm and adds complexity for outsiders trying to parse the language — fitting for a secret tongue.

Key features:
• **Verb stems** carry the core meaning (action)
• **Aspect markers** indicate completion, duration, or intention
• **Tense** may be marked on the aspect portion or through context
