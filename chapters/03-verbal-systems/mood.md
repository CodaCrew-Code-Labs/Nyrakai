# Verb Mood System

Mood indicates the speaker's attitude toward the action: whether it is stated as fact, questioned, commanded, wished, or conditioned. Nyrakai uses suffixes attached after the aspect marker to indicate mood.

## Mood Order

Mood suffixes attach **after** the aspect marker:

```
[VERB ROOT] + [ASPECT] + [MOOD]

tal   + arek  + ka
(say)   (completed) (interrogative)
= talarekka (Did [someone] say?)
```

## The Five Moods

### Declarative (Truth Spoken)

**Suffix:** ∅ (unmarked)

Plain verb + aspect. Used for stating truth directly. Truth needs no adornment.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| talarek | [someone] said / has said |
| taliræn | [someone] is saying |

---

### Interrogative (Truth Questioned)

**Suffix:** -ka (/ka/)

Attached after the aspect. Universal for yes/no and open-ended questions. The seeker places doubt into the chant.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| talarekka | Did [someone] say? |
| talirænka | Is [someone] saying? |

---

### Imperative (Truth Commanded)

**Suffix:** -țiræ (/θirai/)

Long, alien, binding. Used for ritual orders, sacred decrees, and commands that bend reality. Speech as compulsion.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| talarekțiræ | Say it! (completed command) |
| talirænțiræ | Keep saying! (ongoing command) |

**Note:** Imperative is primarily used in sacred/ritual contexts. Informal commands may use a shortened form or context.

---

### Optative (Truth Invoked)

**Suffix:** -hāli (/haːli/)

Airy, breath-like, invoking. Used for blessings, curses, and ritual wishes. Speech as invocation.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| talarekhāli | May [someone] have said |
| talirænhāli | May [someone] be saying |
| n'æra talarekhāli | May truth be spoken |

---

### Conditional (Truth Bound to Fate)

**Suffix:** -wɒț (/wauθ/)

Soft, hypothetical, bound. Used for conditional statements: "if X, then Y" / "would/could" scenarios. Speech as possibility bound to conditions.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| talarekwɒț | If [someone] said / would say |
| talirænwɒț | If [someone] were saying |

**Example:** "If truth were spoken, death would flee"

## Summary Table

| Mood | Suffix | IPA | Function |
|------|--------|-----|----------|
| Declarative | ∅ | — | Statements of fact |
| Interrogative | -ka | /ka/ | Questions |
| Imperative | -țiræ | /θirai/ | Commands, decrees |
| Optative | -hāli | /haːli/ | Wishes, blessings, curses |
| Conditional | -wɒț | /wauθ/ | Hypotheticals, conditions |

---

## Notes

• Declarative is the default; no marking needed for plain statements
• Imperative and optative are primarily ritual/literary; informal speech uses simpler constructions
• The conditional -wɒț uses the sacred ț sound, linking hypotheticals to fate/divine will
• Mood attaches after aspect: VERB + ASPECT + MOOD
