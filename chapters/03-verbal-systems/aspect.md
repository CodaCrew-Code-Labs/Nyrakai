# Verb Aspect System

Aspect indicates how an action unfolds in time: whether it is completed, ongoing, habitual, or potential. Nyrakai uses suffixes attached directly to the verb root to mark aspect.

---

## Aspect Order

Aspect suffixes attach directly to the verb root, before mood:

```
[VERB ROOT] + [ASPECT] + [MOOD]

tal   + arek
(say)   (completed)
= talarek (said / has said)
```

## The Four Aspects

### Completed (Perfective)

**Suffix:** -arek (/arek/)

Lengthens into something solemn. Feels like a "seal" being closed. Marks actions as finished, sealed, binding in eternity.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | talarek | said / has said |
| p^ɛn (see) | p^ɛnarek | saw / has seen |
| dōn (give) | dōnarek | gave / has given |
| r'ōk (die) | r'ōkarek | died / has died |

**Usage:** Past completed actions, eternal truths, sealed fates.

---

### Ongoing (Imperfective / Flowing)

**Suffix:** -iræn (/irain/)

Adds sacred æ for ritual depth. Feels open and flowing. Marks actions as continuous, unending, always in motion.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | taliræn | is saying / speaks |
| p^ɛn (see) | p^ɛniræn | is seeing / watches |
| ƶōr (burn) | ƶōriræn | is burning / burns |
| pæl (walk) | pæliræn | is walking / walks |

**Usage:** Present continuous, ongoing states, processes in motion.

---

### Habitual (Eternal / Cyclical)

**Suffix:** -aneț (/aneθ/)

Harsh -ț ending creates alien, ritual permanence. Feels cyclical, eternal. Marks actions as recurring, customary, tied to cosmic order.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | talaneț | says (habitually) / always says |
| hīra (sun) + tīr (stand) | tīraneț | rises (eternally) |
| nōm (sleep) | nōmaneț | sleeps (regularly) |

**Usage:** Habitual actions, eternal cycles, cosmic patterns, rituals.

---

### Potential (Forbidden / Hidden)

**Suffix:** -ațar (/aθar/)

Uses ț, reserved for sacred/taboo. Dark, heavy, ritualistic. Marks actions as possible, latent, or forbidden.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | talațar | could say / might say (forbidden?) |
| nōr (know) | nōrațar | could know / forbidden knowledge |
| p^ōr (kill) | p^ōrațar | could kill / has killing potential |

**Usage:** Possibilities, latent abilities, forbidden actions, taboo knowledge.

## Summary Table

| Aspect | Suffix | IPA | Function |
|--------|--------|-----|----------|
| Completed | -arek | /arek/ | Finished, sealed, past |
| Ongoing | -iræn | /irain/ | Continuous, present |
| Habitual | -aneț | /aneθ/ | Cyclical, eternal, customary |
| Potential | -ațar | /aθar/ | Possible, latent, forbidden |

---

## Aspect and Time

Nyrakai does not have explicit tense markers (past/present/future). Instead, temporal meaning is derived from:

1. **Aspect choice:** Completed implies past; ongoing implies present
2. **Context:** Time words, surrounding sentences
3. **Ritual framing:** Sacred speech exists outside linear time

This reflects the worldview of the Ŧɒñœrek: truth is eternal, and the moment of speaking collapses past, present, and future.

## Notes

• Aspect attaches directly to verb root: VERB + ASPECT
• Mood (if any) attaches after aspect: VERB + ASPECT + MOOD
• The potential aspect (-ațar) carries sacred/taboo weight; use carefully
• Habitual (-aneț) is often used for cosmic/divine actions (sun rising, tides, fate)
