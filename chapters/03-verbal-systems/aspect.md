# Verb Aspect System

Aspect indicates how an action unfolds in time: whether it is completed, ongoing, habitual, or potential. Nyrakai uses suffixes attached directly to the verb root to mark aspect.

---

## Aspect Order

Aspect suffixes attach directly to the verb root, before mood:

```
[VERB ROOT] + [ASPECT] + [MOOD]

tal   + arek
(say)   (completed)
= talarek (said / has said)
```

## The Four Aspects

### Completed (Perfective)

**Suffix:** -arek (/arek/)

Lengthens into something solemn. Feels like a "seal" being closed. Marks actions as finished, sealed, binding in eternity.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | talarek | said / has said |
| yɛn (see) | yɛnarek | saw / has seen |
| dōn (give) | dōnarek | gave / has given |
| r'ōk (die) | r'ōkarek | died / has died |

**Usage:** Past completed actions, eternal truths, sealed fates.

**Universal Truths:** Statements about how things fundamentally ARE use completed aspect, not habitual. The completed aspect implies "this truth is established, sealed, complete." For example:

> *n'ærñorñen əda šōrænñen hræk^ewarek zašōr əda trōm t^ōl țræn*
> "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights"

Uses `hræk^ewarek` (born-completed) because it's a universal truth that is established.

**Note on Collective Singular:** When using the universal quantifier `t^ōl` (all), the noun remains singular to express the collective whole. `t^ōl țræn` = "all human" (humanity as one), not `t^ōl țrænænœ`.

### Ongoing (Imperfective / Flowing)

**Suffix:** -iræn (/irain/)

Adds sacred æ for ritual depth. Feels open and flowing. Marks actions as continuous, unending, always in motion.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | taliræn | is saying / speaks |
| yɛn (see) | yɛniræn | is seeing / watches |
| ƶōr (burn) | ƶōriræn | is burning / burns |
| pæl (walk) | pæliræn | is walking / walks |

**Usage:** Present continuous, ongoing states, processes in motion.

---

### Habitual (Eternal / Cyclical)

**Suffix:** -aneț (/aneθ/)

Harsh -ț ending creates alien, ritual permanence. Feels cyclical, eternal. Marks actions as recurring, customary, tied to cosmic order.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | talaneț | says (habitually) / always says |
| hīra (sun) + stīr (stand) | stīraneț | rises (eternally) |
| slōm (sleep) | slōmaneț | sleeps (regularly) |

**Usage:** Habitual actions, eternal cycles, cosmic patterns, rituals.

---

### Potential (Forbidden / Hidden)

**Suffix:** -ațar (/aθar/)

Uses ț, reserved for sacred/taboo. Dark, heavy, ritualistic. Marks actions as possible, latent, or forbidden.

| Verb | + Aspect | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| tal (say) | talațar | could say / might say (forbidden?) |
| šōr (know) | šōrațar | could know / forbidden knowledge |
| p^ōr (kill) | p^ōrațar | could kill / has killing potential |

**Usage:** Possibilities, latent abilities, forbidden actions, taboo knowledge.

## Summary Table

| Aspect | Suffix | IPA | Function |
|--------|--------|-----|----------|
| Completed | -arek | /arek/ | Finished, sealed, past |
| Ongoing | -iræn | /irain/ | Continuous, present |
| Habitual | -aneț | /aneθ/ | Cyclical, eternal, customary |
| Potential | -ațar | /aθar/ | Possible, latent, forbidden |

---

## Aspect and Time

Nyrakai does not have explicit tense markers (past/present/future). Instead, temporal meaning is derived from:

1. **Aspect choice:** Completed implies past; ongoing implies present
2. **Context:** Time words, surrounding sentences
3. **Ritual framing:** Sacred speech exists outside linear time

This reflects the worldview of the Ŧɒñœrek: truth is eternal, and the moment of speaking collapses past, present, and future.

---

## Notes

• Aspect attaches directly to verb root: VERB + ASPECT
• Mood (if any) attaches after aspect: VERB + ASPECT + MOOD
• The potential aspect (-ațar) carries sacred/taboo weight; use carefully
• Habitual (-aneț) is often used for cosmic/divine actions (sun rising, tides, fate)

---

## Voice

Nyrakai distinguishes between **active** and **passive** voice using the suffix **-rōn**.

### Active Voice (unmarked)

The default form. The subject performs the action.

| Verb | Active | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| dur (use) | fā durarek | I used |
| yɛn (see) | fā yɛniræn | I am seeing |

### Passive Voice: -rōn

**Suffix:** -rōn (/roːn/)

The patient (receiver of action) becomes the subject. The agent may be omitted or marked with instrumental (-ek).

| Verb | Passive | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| dur (use) | durrōn | be used |
| yɛn (see) | yɛnrōn | be seen |
| tal (say) | talrōn | be said/told |
| zrāl (kill) | zrālrōn | be killed |

### Examples

- **"I can be used"** → durrōnațar fā (use-PASS-POT I)
- **"The truth is known"** → n'æra šōrrōnarek (truth know-PASS-COMPL)
- **"Songs are sung by them"** → k^ælñen talrōniræn šāri-ek (song-PL say-PASS-ONGO they-INSTR)

### Attachment Order

Voice attaches directly to verb root, before aspect and mood:

```
VERB + VOICE + ASPECT + MOOD
dur  + rōn   + ațar   = durrōnațar (can be used)
```

### Notes

- Passive implies the action is received, not performed
- Agent can be specified with instrumental case (-ek): "by someone"
- Passive + Potential (-rōnațar) expresses capability of receiving action
