## Overview

Nyrakai features several sounds uncommon in European languages:

- **Ejective consonants** (k', p', t') — produced with a sharp burst of air
- **Affricates** (ƨ, š, ƶ, ŧ) — combined sounds like ts, tch, dz, tr
- **Velar nasal** (ñ) — the "ng" sound, allowed at the start of words
- **Glottal modified vowels** — the ' marker adds a schwa + glottal stop

This combination creates the distinctive "sharp yet melodic" quality of the language.
