| k | /k/ | "kite" | kōm (come) |
| l | /l/ | "lamp" | lem (hear) |
| m | /m/ | "map" | mōk (dry) |
| n | /n/ | "net" | nōr (know) |
| ñ | /ŋ/ | "sing" | ñœr (many) |
| p | /p/ | "pen" | pæl (walk) |
| r | /r/ | "run" (trilled) | r'ōk (death) |
| s | /s/ | "sun" | sem (good) |
| t | /t/ | "top" | tal (say) |
| ț | /θ/ | "think" | țūn (drink) |
| z | /z/ | "zoo" | zæ (not) |

## Glides (2)

| Letter | IPA | Sound | Example |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| w | /w/ | "wet" | wōr (flesh) |
| y | /j/ | "yes" | yām (we) |

## Ejectives (3)

Ejectives are produced with a sharp burst of air from the glottis, creating a "popping" sound. They are written with a caret (^) after the consonant.

| Letter | IPA | Sound | Example |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| k^ | /k'/ | sharp "k" | k^œl (zero) |
| p^ | /p'/ | sharp "p" | p^œr (four) |
| t^ | /t'/ | sharp "t" | t^ūn (one) |

Ejectives are uncommon in European languages but found in many indigenous American, African, and Caucasian languages. They give Nyrakai its distinctive ancient, alien quality.

**Note:** The caret (^) is used for ejectives to distinguish them from the glottal marker (') used in patterns like n'æ.

## Affricates (4)

Affricates combine a stop and a fricative into a single consonant sound.

| Letter | IPA | Sound | Example |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|
| ƨ | /ts/ | "cats" | ƨœn (skin) |
| š | /tʃ/ | "church" | šœ (this) |
| ƶ | /dz/ | "adze" | ƶōr (burn) |
| ŧ | /tr/ | "tree" | ŧōn (bone) |
