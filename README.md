# Nyrakai: The Tongue of Truth

**Nyrakai** (/ˈnaɪrəkaɪ/; NAI-rah-kai), from *n'æ* (true) + *kæ* (tongue), is a constructed fictional artistic language created by Ronin Nikolaides for the fantasy/science fiction series *Ashes of Origin*.

Within the narrative, it is depicted as a 4,000 year old secret tongue preserved by an esoteric society known as the **Ŧɒñœrek** (/traʊŋɔɪrek/; The Nine Unknown), carried forward into a dystopian world nearly 950 years in the future. Nyrakai is believed to encode traces of forbidden knowledge within its own words, guarded across generations in secrecy and ritual.

The language features ejective consonants, a verb final word order, and a strict syllable structure that gives it a distinctive rhythmic quality: sharp yet melodic, ancient yet precise.
